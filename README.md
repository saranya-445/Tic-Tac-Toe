# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview 
This project is a Java implementation of the Tic-Tac-Tie game, featuring both a standard 3x3 board and a dynamic grid size. It supports multiple gameplay including player-versus-player and player-versus-computer and computer-versus-computer.
The progect was developed as a part of the **2OP3** course at **McMaster University** to demostrate fundamental Java programming concepts.

## Features
* Supports both a standard **3x3 grid** and a **user-defined grid size**
* Multiple gameplay modes:
    * Player vs Player
    * Player vs Computer
    * Computer vs Computer
* Checks Win and Draw Conditions
    * Validates winning conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals
    * Detects draw states when the board is full
